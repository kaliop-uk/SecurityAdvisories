# INSECURE ALTERNATIVE to Roave Security Advisories

This package has the sole purpose of neutralizing the roave/security-advisories package when it is f.e. pulled in by a
dependency of your library, and it breaks CI builds by preventing an installation of the complete app.

*DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT TESTING!*
